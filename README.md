## The Competency, Proficiency, and Fluency Spectrum

Students should be in the "proficient to fluent" range with the all of the material presented in this repo.

### Competency
Competency refers to the bare minimum required for acceptability. It represents the minimum threshold of accomplishment. Below competency, one
is incompetent. Competent is knowing a skill, regardless of how effectively one
is able to apply that skill.

### Proficiency
Proficiency refers to attaining a level of accomplishment or mastery in using a skill. Proficiency is both a measure of performance and a set of observable behaviors that describe what is produced and how it is produced. Proficiency implies effectiveness at exercising a skill.

### Fluency
Fluency refers to familiarity and ease with which one does the work. It is the 
ability to code easily and accurately. Repetition and practice are the way to 
build fluency.
